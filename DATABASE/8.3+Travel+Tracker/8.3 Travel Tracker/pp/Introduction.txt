Good afternoon everyone. My name is Susheel Kumar Rai, and I hail from Khalilabad, Uttar Pradesh. It is known for its bustling marketplace, the Bardahiya Bazaar.

I live in a nuclear family of four: myself, my father, mother, and brother.  My father works as a contractor, while my mother is a homemaker.

I completed my 10th grade at St. Thomas Inter College and my 12th grade at Woodland Academy. Currently, I'm pursuing a BTech degree in Computer Science Engineering at Abes Engineering College.

In addition to my academic studies, I've actively developed my technical skills. I've honed my proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++, and recently completed a full-stack web development course.  To showcase my learning, I've built projects like the React_contact App, Abes Integrated Survey Portal, Spark Cast, and a note_keeper app.

I possess strong decision-making abilities and can adapt to diverse work environments.  I'm a quick learner, highly motivated, and results-oriented. I'm comfortable working both independently and as part of a team.

While I sometimes take on too much responsibility at once, I'm actively improving it by taking note of all my tasks, personal and professional. This helps me to visualize my workload.

Thank you for your time.
